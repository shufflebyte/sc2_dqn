Description: PySC2 - StarCraft II Learning Environment
        
        PySC2 is DeepMind's Python component of the StarCraft II Learning Environment
        (SC2LE). It exposes Blizzard Entertainment's StarCraft II Machine Learning API
        as a Python RL Environment. This is a collaboration between DeepMind and
        Blizzard to develop StarCraft II into a rich environment for RL research. PySC2
        provides an interface for RL agents to interact with StarCraft 2, getting
        observations and sending actions.
        
        We have published an accompanying blogpost and paper
        https://deepmind.com/blog/deepmind-and-blizzard-open-starcraft-ii-ai-research-environment/
        which outlines our motivation for using StarCraft II for DeepRL research, and
        some initial research results using the environment.
